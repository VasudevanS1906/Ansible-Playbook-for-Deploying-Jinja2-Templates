    <h1>Ansible-Playbook-for-Deploying-Jinja2-Templates</h1>
    <p>Developed and implemented an Ansible playbook for deploying Jinja2 templates across multiple servers, streamlining the configuration management process. The playbook leveraged Jinja2's templating capabilities to dynamically populate configuration files with host-specific values, ensuring consistent and accurate deployments across the infrastructure. This automation solution reduced manual effort, minimized potential human errors, and improved overall operational efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Project Description - Ansible Playbook for Deploying Jinja2 Templates</h2>
    <p>This repository contains an Ansible playbook and a Jinja2 template file for deploying configurations to multiple servers. The playbook leverages Jinja2's templating capabilities to dynamically populate configuration files with host-specific values, ensuring consistent deployments across the infrastructure.</p>

    <p>The playbook performs the following tasks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copies a Jinja2 template file (template.j2) from the control node to the target servers.</li>
        <li>Renders the Jinja2 template using Ansible facts (e.g., hostname, distribution) to populate the configuration values.</li>
        <li>Deploys the rendered configuration file (template.txt) to the specified location on the target servers.</li>
        <li>This automation solution streamlines the configuration management process, reduces manual effort, and minimizes potential human errors during deployments.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have Ansible installed and configured with the target servers' inventory file (hosts).</li>
        <li>Copy the template.j2 and template.yml files to the appropriate locations on the control node.</li>
        <li>Run the playbook using the command: ansible-playbook -i hosts template.yml</li>
        <li>Verify the deployment by checking the template.txt file on the target servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project demonstrates the use of Ansible and Jinja2 templates for configuration management and can be extended or adapted to fit specific deployment requirements.</p>
